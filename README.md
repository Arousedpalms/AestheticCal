# Madi's Custom Calendar Widget ðŸ“…

Hello! I'm Madi. I decided to create this calendar widget because I couldn't find one that matched the aesthetic I was aiming for. If you've stumbled across this, I hope you find it useful for your own projects!

## Features
- Minimalist and clean design
- Highlighted current day
- Easily navigable months

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Link the CSS and JS files to your HTML page.
3. Place the calendar structure (`<div class="calendar">...</div>`) wherever you'd like the widget to appear.
4. That's it! You should now see the calendar on your page.

## Customization
Feel free to tweak the CSS to match your website or application's aesthetic. The core functionality is in the JavaScript, so as long as you don't modify the class names or IDs, the calendar should function properly.

## License
This project is free to use, modify, and distribute. A shoutout or attribution would be appreciated but is not required.

## Feedback and Contributions
If you have suggestions, find a bug, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out! Contributions are always welcome.
